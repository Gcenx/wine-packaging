		<p><b>Thank you for installing {{ =pretty_name }}</b></p>
		<p>
			You can now start Wine by using the {{ =pretty_name }} entry in your Launcher. This will open a terminal with further instructions on how to use Wine. Alternatively you can directly start a Windows executable by double clicking on it.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to know more about Wine, you can take a look at the <a href="https://www.winehq.org/docs/wineusr-guide/index">Wine User Guide</a>. If you encounter any bugs with the installer or Wine itself, you can report them at <a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/">bugs.winehq.org</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that this package doesn't contain an update function yet - it is therefore recommended to periodically check <a href="https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/macosx/download.html">winehq.org</a> for updates.
